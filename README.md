### Hey! I'm Benjamin. 👋

I'm currently an engineer at [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com/space/) working on space systems, and a masters student at the [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu)

- 🔬 Currently researching serverless functions, edge computing, and WebAssembly with the [gwsystems lab](https://github.com/gwsystems) 
  - Check out [sledge](https://github.com/gwsystems/sledge-serverless-framework) and [aWsm](https://github.com/gwsystems/awsm)
- Some of my previous work
  - 🔋 SWE at [Tesla Energy](https://tesla.com/energy) working on distributed systems & batteries in the cloud
  - 🏥 Systems at [Johns Hopkins](https://hopkinsmedicine.org/about) working on critical infrastructure
- 🌱 Outside of research I'm currently learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/marascoben)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge fan of the [SmartLess](https://www.smartless.com/) podcast, and I'm currently growing a few (too many) lemon trees
